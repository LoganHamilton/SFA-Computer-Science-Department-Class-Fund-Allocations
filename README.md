# SFA Computer Science Department Class Fund Allocations
In this project, I was given a data set that contained 42,483 courses that were taken by students in the computer science department from 2011-2021

I was tasked with finding out which classes within this dataset that has the highest D-Fail-Withdraw (DFW) Rates. I used these DFW rates to find which days and time-slots certain classes tend to perform the best.

I used pandas,seaborne, and matplotlib for this analysis.

I presented my findings to the board of Computer Science at SFA to help them decide how to most effeciently allocate resource funds (AARC Tutoring, Hiring new professors, etc.) and how to properly schedule classes depending on class time and class days.
